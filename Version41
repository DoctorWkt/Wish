Version 41:
This version isn't really documented very well. I think I moved the code
from SCCS to RCS after porting it back to FreeBSD 1 and Minix 1.7, so
the code shouldn't be radically different from the last version 40. From
now on, I will put `closed on [date]' on the version number in this file.
Added lots of ifdefs to turn off functionality; this might help for when
we do regression testing. Now I need a proper `ifdef' remover program :-)
