System Defines
--------------

	For each and every system, one and one only system define is needed.
The current list of available system defines is below.

#define AUX2_01		/* A/UX 2.01 */
#define OSX5_1_BSD	/* Pyramid OSx 5.1a, BSD Universe */
#define COHERENT	/* Coherent */
#define GENBSD		/* Generic 4.x BSD machine */
#define GENSYSV		/* Generic SysV machine */
#define J386BSD0_1	/* 386BSD-0.1 */
#define MINIX1_5	/* Minix 1.5 */
#define SUNOS3		/* Sun OS 3.x */
#define SUNOS4		/* Sun OS 4.x */
#define OSX5_1_ATT	/* Pyramid under OSx 5.1a, SysV Universe */
#define ULTRIX4_2	/* Ultrix 4.2 */


Operating System Defines
------------------------

	A lot of code is #ifdef'd according to the type of operating system
where the code is compiled. Five operating system types are defined below.
Only one of these should be defined. Also given is the list of system
defines that define the operating system type.

#define ATT		/* System V release < 4 */
		GENSYSV
		OSX5_1_ATT

#define POSIX		/* An OS with POSIX system calls */
		AUX2_01
		J386BSD0_1
		SUNOS4

#define UCB		/* 4.x BSD */
		OSX5_1_BSD
		GENBSD
		SUNOS3
		ULTRIX4_2

#define COHERENT	/* Coherent */
		COHERENT

#define MINIX1_5	/* Minix 1.5 */
		MINIX1_5


Job Control
-----------

	There are four styles of job control available: 7th Edition Unix
job control (using ptrace), Berkeley job control, POSIX job control and
no job control whatsoever. These are enabled by the following defines, only
one of which should be defined.

#define POSIXJOB	/* POSIX job control */
#define V7JOB		/* 7th Edition Unix job control */
#define UCBJOB		/* Berkeley job control */


Argument Passing
----------------

	The prints() [and friends] functions take a variable number of
arguments. Where possible, argument passing macros should be used. There
are three main types: no argument passing macros, varargs.h style argument
passing and stdarg.h stype argument passing macros. These are enabled by the
following defines, only one of which should be defined.

#define VARARGS		/* varargs.h style argument passing */
#define STDARG		/* stdarg.h stype argument passing */


Miscellaneous
-------------

	There are a few other miscellaneous defines which control things
like types of functions used for directory searches, current working directory
information.

#define USES_GETWD	/* Uses getwd(), not getcwd() */

#define PLONG int	/* The type of arguments to ptrace(). Minix 1.5 */
			/* uses longs! This is only used when V7JOB is on */

#define SIGTYPE void	/* Signal handlers return this type. Usually void or */
			/* int, but might also be __sighandler_t */

#define USES_DIRECT	/* Uses struct direct, not struct dirent */

#define PROTO		/* The compiler supports Ansi-C prototyped function */
			/* declarations */

#define DEBUG		/* Debugging code in Wish is #ifdef'd with this. You */
			/* should not need (or want) to turn this on. */
