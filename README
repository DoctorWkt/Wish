Here are the various versions of my Unix command-line shell called Wish.
This was written as a smaller replacement for the Clam shell by Callum
Gibson, but with most of the functionality of tcsh.

The files ending in .gz are shell archives. You will need to gunzip them
and then execute the file as a shell script, e.g

	% gunzip v6.gz
	% sh v6

The .tar.gz files are gzipped tarballs.

Most of the early versions were written before 1996, and so will need
porting to newer versions of Unix or Linux. See wish_history.gif for
a rough guide to the dates of various releases.

The early versions were based on the shell in Marc Rochkind's book
``Advanced UNIX Programming''. While now dated, this is still a
great book to learn about Unix system programming.
