Things to do on Wish 2.0
------------------------

The token parsing in meta.c is pretty awful. I've come up with a much more
elegant token parser for the shell, but I haven't merged it into the current
code as the types of tokens have changed.

I'm toying with the idea of moving alias expansion into the command line
expansion, instead of treating it as a `builtin shell script'. This would
simplify a lot of the code, e.g removing the isalias stuff everywhere.

The redirection code and the file code is also a bit ugly. The new meta
tokeniser will have an impact on the redirection code, and I should fix
the file code at the same time.

There are still job control flaws, mainly because trying to grok the new
POSIX job control method gives me a headache. I need to sit down and really
nut this one out.

Ensure that NO stdio code is compiled into the shell, especially on Minix.
This was the reason I moved to prints() from printf(). Makes the shell an
awful lot smaller.

Is the shell 8-bit clean? I should really try to use uchar everywhere.

Can I use the val.c code anywhere else in the shell?

Comlined still needs a full rewrite, this is the only code that is
substantially based on the old clam code. Best to start from scratch on
this one.
